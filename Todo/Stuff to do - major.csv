"-Make sure the battle system works in relativity. Mario should be able to identify where an enemy is in real time instead of being programmed to do a specific animation for each individual enemy"
"-Make sure Mario's sprite doesn't disappear"
"-Give the Goomba 3HP so it has a chance to attack"
"-First Strikes (jumping on the enemy to initiate a battle)"
"-The timing of the A press (Has to be as Mario lands on the goomba, usually a 6 frame window to input it.)"
"-Mario's 2nd Jump (Mario does two jumps if the A button is pressed, instead of extra damage)"
"-Blocking (mario can reduce the damage by 1 with a well timed A press)"
